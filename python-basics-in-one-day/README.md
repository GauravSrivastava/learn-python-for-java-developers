Assuming that the learner already has 3+ years of Java experience, we can fast-track your Python learning by focusing on syntax differences, Pythonic idioms, and core libraries. 

Here's a one-day crash course plan

üïê Python in One Day for Java Developers

Hour 1: Python Basics
  Variables, data types (int, float, str, bool)
  Dynamic typing vs Java's static typing
  Indentation instead of braces
  print(), input(), and basic I/O

Hour 2: Control Flow
  if, elif, else
  for and while loops
  range(), enumerate(), zip()

Hour 3: Functions and Scoping
  def, default arguments, *args, **kwargs
  First-class functions, lambdas
  Variable scope: local, global, nonlocal

Hour 4: Data Structures
  Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
  List comprehensions
  Mutability and performance tips

Hour 5: Object-Oriented Python
  Classes, __init__, self
  Inheritance, super()
  Dunder methods (__str__, __repr__, etc.)

Hour 6: Modules and Packages
  import, from ... import ...
  Standard library: os, sys, datetime, collections
  Virtual environments and pip

Hour 7: File I/O and Exceptions
  Reading/writing files
  try, except, finally
  Context managers (with statement)

Hour 8: Pythonic Patterns & Tools
  Idiomatic Python (EAFP, duck typing)
  map(), filter(), reduce()
  itertools, functools, dataclasses

Hour 9: Testing and Debugging
  unittest, pytest
  pdb for debugging
  Type hints and mypy

Hour 10: Real-World Practice
  Build a CLI tool or REST API using Flask or FastAPI
  Use requests to call an API
  Parse JSON, handle errors
